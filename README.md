# C' (C Prime)

C' is a C11 language with extensions. 
The ouput is C89 compatible with C++. 
C' keeps your formatting macros and comments. (We can also reformat in the future)

## How can it help?

The task of code abstraction creates patterns and these patterns repeats.
C' has some build-in patterns and let you write your compiler extension to instanciate new parametrized types and functions.
